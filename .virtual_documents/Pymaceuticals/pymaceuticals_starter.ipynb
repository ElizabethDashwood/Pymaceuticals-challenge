    # Determine outliers using upper and lower bounds


# Generate a box plot that shows the distrubution of the tumor volume for each treatment group.






# Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin



# Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight vs. the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen






# Calculate the correlation coefficient and a linear regression model 
# for mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen
